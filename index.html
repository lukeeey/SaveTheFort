        <h1>What's going on?</h1>
        <p>
            Fort Regent should be the crown jewel of St Helier—a thriving hub of sport, leisure, and culture that
            benefits the entire community. Instead, it has been allowed to fall into an unacceptable state of
            disrepair, with no clear vision for its present or future. On an island of such wealth, how has this
            been allowed to happen?
        </p>
        <p>
            For decades, the Fort has been a cornerstone of public well-being, providing accessible facilities
            that promote health, fitness, and social connection. Its historical significance as a military
            fortification adds further weight to the argument for its preservation and revitalization. Repurposing
            it for private or commercial interests would be a betrayal of its value to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jersey deserves better. Fort Regent must be restored, reimagined, and reinvigorated—not left to decay
            due to neglect and short-sighted decision-making

                    political representatives plan to vote on the issue. More importantly, they need to hear the
                    voices of the people of Jersey.</p>
